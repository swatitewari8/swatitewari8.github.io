            <p>
                My name is Swati Tewari and was born and brought up in Kanpur city, in
                India, which is famous for its leather and textile industries. I am
                currently in my first year of the Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) program
                from the university of Ottawa, Canada. I am a teacher candidate of year
                2023. I am in the Intermediate/Senior (I/S) division and my teachable
                subjects are Chemistry and Mathematics. Learning has been my passion and
                I have been a continuous life-long learner. I hold a doctoral degree
                (PhD) in Organic Chemistry from Central Drug Research Institute, India;
                a Master of Science (MSc) degree in Chemistry from Indian Institute of
                Technology (IIT), Kanpur, India; Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in
                Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics from India and an MBA degree from
                University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada. I have taught as a professor in
                Sheridan College, Brampton, Canada; Dawson College, Montréal, Canada and
                Amity University, Noida, India. Some of the subjects that I taught at
                the undergraduate and graduate levels include Chemistry, Physics for
                Chemical Sciences, Environmental Sciences, Introductory Mathematics and
                various courses in Management domain. I have also worked as a research
                scientist and research manager in pharmaceutical industries in Canada.
                My other professional engagements include having worked as a post
                doctoral fellow at the Max-Planck Institute of Molecular Physiology,
                Dortmund, Germany and City University of New York, NY, USA. My research
                interest areas are spread across drug discovery and design as
                antiparasitic, antibacterial and pain killer agents. I have published
                several research articles in peer reviewed journals.

            <h3>Camping</h3>
            <p>
                When the sun in shining and the weather is nice, you can be sure that I
                will be out for camping! I have done most of my camping in the KOA
                campsites in North America. I had also a great opportunity to do camping
                in India in 2012 during Kumbh-Mela, Allahabad city (now known as
                Prayagraj) in a totally different spiritual setting. I have been an avid
                camper since 2009 and have done camping in various national parks and
                beaches in various provinces of Canada (British Columbia, Alberta,
                Prince Edward Island and Quebec) and USA (Montana, South Dakota,
                Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Colorado, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania). My
                last camping was in August, 2021 in Sauble Beach, Ontario, Canada.
