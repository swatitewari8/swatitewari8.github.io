                <h2>Blog-1: Practicum Experience</h2>

I was given the golden opportunity of learning throughout during my spring practicum placement, 2022. I was teaching general science to grade 10 students. Since I joined the practicum in spring, I was offered to teach the subject biology as it was only left over by AT as other sections of general science from chemistry, physics and climate change topics have already been covered. Although my teachable subjects are chemistry and mathematics (intermediate/senior), so my assumption was that I will get the chemistry or math to teach but I was given subject biology to teach. It was very challenging task for me as I read biology when I was in grade 10. I had to learn the biology while preparing class lectures. My workload was very high as I had to not only prepare and organize the biology content material and ppt slides but also to learn the subject. Since I was teaching virtually, I had to upload content and slides further in advance on D2L. I had to prepare unit and lesson plans further in advance of teaching dates to allow more time for editing and review. Overall, I took this practicum as a challenge as I had to learn the biology as a student as well as deliver the content as a teacher. I felt that every day is different, no mundane or repetitive work.
All the lesson and activity plan I have created for my students thus far was based on what I learned in PED 3141 from the structure to the creativity of the lesson implementation. But I struggled to follow activity and lesson plan implementation in structured manner as I did while learning PED 3141. I participated in land acknowledgement and presented relevant thoughts which I learned in PED 3138.
Due to weather circumstances, power outages, school closures and general timing of this practicum, I got to experience the need to continually shift and change my plans as the situation evolved.  I had been building skills and listening and learning throughout the process. Although, I created a solid initial unit plan draft for grade 10 biology but modified it with assistance of AT as lessons evolved.  My lessons involved sharing of important information, opportunities for students to work with the material themselves both individually and in groups and created opportunities for discussion.
I had the opportunity to observe and discuss some extreme examples of individual differentiation.  As above, the virtual environment limited my ability to build skills in classroom management. In the virtual environment, I had very limited non-verbal communication coming from the students as most of the students put their camera off. I responded well to students who were receptive but struggled to draw out those who were quiet. 
I engaged with students and staff in a professional manner and build a positive rapport with students and staff and responded well to their queries and suggestions. Many students expressed sadness before the last day of the semester, and they indicated that they had enjoyed having me as a teacher. I felt that students were bonded with me, and I invested in their success and their lives. Ultimately, I felt rewarded in making some meaningful relationship with students. 
During my next practicum, I will explore greater differentiation of course material based on student responses to meet individual student needs. I will prepare unit and lesson plans further in advance of teaching dates to allow greater time devoted to teaching and planning. I will try to become fully comfortable with the full Google Suite of programs and other technology skills to improve as an educator. I will engage students who are quiet in the class by developing mid-lesson techniques to assess student comprehension of material without testing.

<h2>Blog-2: The Myth of the Drunken Indian</h2>

The author Chelsie Vowel talks about the three main beliefs that people have pertaining to Indigenous peoples and their use of alcohol. The first belief is that Indigenous people cannot metabolize alcohol and are alcoholic because of that. But through scientific research it has been proven that all human beings have the genes that metabolize alcohol in their bodies.  The race and ethnicity have nothing to do with metabolizing alcohol and the main factors are genetics, age, mental health, emotional pain trauma etc. The second belief is that all natives are drunks while from statistics drinking is a problem in some communities not all indigenous people consume more. The First Nations adults abstain more from alcohol consumption than non-indigenous people and they also consume less frequently than non-indigenous people on a weekly basis. On the other hand, statistics show that First Nations people are more heavy drinkers than the general population. The third belief is that alcohol abuse is an Indigenous cultural trait, however, alcohol and even substance use was not historically part of many Indigenous cultures or their protective societal fabric.  Rather, it was introduced deliberately as a part of European colonization to increase their profits and control. European colonists first introduced heavy drinking which led to violence against indigenous peoples. Authorities were not successful in restricting alcohol consumption among their colonists, traders, and soldiers. The attention then got focussed on banning the provision of alcohol for Indigenous peoples. The Indian Act Prohibited the sale of alcohol to First Nations (1884 - 1985) and then alcohol was banned for indigenous peoples. The violation of the rule led to imprisonment for a month. Since they couldn't buy liquor, they ended up drinking more dangerous substances. Afterwards, the gradual civilization act was enacted, where the use of alcohol impacted good moral character of the indigenous. Because of alcohol consumption, widowed Indian women were found lacking in a “good moral character” and therefore their children were taken away. I am surprised to notice that these kinds of consequences remained in place in Indian Act legislation until 1980s. 
According to statistics Canada survey, the Aboriginal peoples showed that 73% of the First Nations respondents reported that alcohol was a problem in their communities. For these reasons excessive drinking among Aboriginal youth must be considered an important public health concern. I am wondering that how come these problems still persists in Canada and of course, actions must have been taken by the Canadian government for indigenous healthcare, but so far, no significant improvement in indigenous peoples’ health condition is apparent. What could be the possible reason?  I believe, the high incidence of substance use among this population has been attributed to the legacies of colonization which alienated Indigenous population. The colonization contributed to many problems like intergenerational trauma, racism, child welfare issues, Indian agents, suppressing their cultural beliefs and practices, and creating isolated reserves. I strongly agree that substance abuse has been weaponized against Indigenous peoples in Canada but now the question arises what is the solution of this problem? In the past, many external programs have been implemented to prevent substance abuse but were not effective as they were not in the context of indigenous-specific culture. Therefore, there is a need for substance abuse prevention and treatment strategies that integrate Indigenous traditions. Prevention programs have the potential to reduce substance use among Indigenous adolescents, especially when they are developed in partnership with Indigenous people. These programs should include cultural knowledge enhancement, components of skill development, and substance-related education. The substance related education can be delivered in community, family, and school settings. There is an urgent need for more financial and time investment in conducting rigorous alternative research designs and their evaluations to strengthen the evidence base data. There is a need for behavioural change communication to make them understand the importance of good health and substance abuse. At first, religious leaders and community leaders should be contacted and eventually a 360-degree communication methodology should be adopted. The school-based programs should be designed to prevent or decrease excessive drinking among Aboriginal youth. Being a teacher candidate, I strongly feel that culturally appropriate prevention programs are needed for Indigenous youth in elementary, intermediate, and senior schools in Canada. The prevention programs should be culturally responsive and provide students with the knowledge and skills to prevent and manage substance use in real-life situations. There is an urgent need of prevention programs for Indigenous youth.
I am an immigrant who came to Canada from India in 2004. I had a very good image about Canada for being a friendly and safe place to live and raise family. Canada is one among the topmost 3 most popular countries globally which is known for quality of life. I was surprised to know about such deliberate, comprehensive, and prolonged assault of Aboriginal people in Canada. The most astonishing fact is that many Canadians are still unaware of the full scope of these injustices and their impacts. One question which is persistently boggling my mind that how come in Canada with a very high human development Index (HDI, 0.929 in 2019), such kind of inhuman behaviour has been continuing.

Discussion Questions:

Q.1	The effects of colonization are apparent in all aspects of Indigenous peoples’ health and well-being. Indigenous peoples in Canada experience a disproportionate burden of ill health compared to the non-Indigenous population. I would pose a question that what government policies have been established and implemented so far to mitigate these health disparities within Canada?
Q.2	What kind of policies have been practiced by the Canadian government for substance abuse prevention and treatment strategies that would help integrating Indigenous traditions? I would ask -What is the main bottleneck in practicing strategies that integrate Indigenous traditions?

<h2>Blog-3: Integrating Indigenous culture perspective while teaching Mathematics</h2>
 
Canada is a nation that is built upon three founding pillars—Aboriginal, francophone and anglophone. However, Canada’s school curricula have historically been very Eurocentric. Canadian society has been ignoring the contribution of Indigenous peoples in the shaping of Canada. But Indigenous Peoples have been on these lands for millennia and have their own ways of teaching and knowing that are largely ignored in the current education system. If any one of the three pillars is weak, then the whole nation becomes unstable and risks falling over. Therefore, ancient foundations are required to be understood and maintained and this can be achieved through education. The current situation in Canada is increasingly asking educators to take up the mandate and responsibility to integrate Indigenous perspectives into curricula. Seeing the current scenario in Canada, there is a need of pedagogical practices through which curriculum can be a bridge for building a new relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples. Integrating culture-based teaching materials and strategies into math curriculum is important to achieve decolonization in Canadian education system. This integration will represent a historical shift from conventional approaches to mathematics education and advance the academic achievement for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous students. There some challenges in meeting this goal as curriculum innovators’ actions challenge standard curricula and instruction. There is need of critical analysis to illustrate that how can educators decide which taken-for-granted notions about school mathematics should continue to be embraced and which ones should be updated. There is need to identify concrete ways in which mathematics educators, researchers, and curriculum writers can integrate Indigenous cultures which simultaneously promotes both academic achievement and reconciliation.

Since my teachable are science and math, I can integrate Indigenous culture while teaching math. For example, I can a make a lesson plan of “the geometry of building a tipi” through Desmos. I will also include the science of tipi in connection with environment. It will promote academic achievement as well as reconciliation.
Blog-4: Integrating Indigenous perspective in grade-10 Science
Canada’s school curricula have historically been very Eurocentric. The current situation in Canada is increasingly asking educators to take up the mandate and responsibility to integrate Indigenous perspectives into curricula. Therefore, ancient foundations are required to be understood and maintained and this can be achieved through education.

During my first practicum, I taught Grade 10, Academic Science (SNC2D). I taught Biology and helped in assignments of chemistry, optics and earth and space science. During my teaching I wish I could have included Indigenous perspective but due to time restrictions, I couldn’t do it. There are many ways in which indigenous content can be incorporated in science curriculum.

-Biology- B1.3 “describe public health strategies related to systems biology (e.g., cancer screening and prevention programs; vaccines against the human papillomavirus [HPV] and measles, mumps, and rubella [MMR]; AIDS education), and assess their impact on society”. My class was international so I could have facilitated a discussion in the class about different public health strategies taken by different cultures in vaccination of COVID-19.  As a part of the assignment, students would have presented their work in groups of their own choice. In this way, students would have gained the knowledge of health systems in different cultures including indigenous cultures.

-Chemistry- C1.1 “analyse, on the basis of research, various safety and environmental issues associated with chemical reactions and their reactants and/or product(s) (e.g., chemical reactions related to the use of cyanide in gold mining, the corrosion of metal supports on bridges, the use of different antibacterial agents such as chlorine and bromine in recreational pools)”. I could have prompted a discussion in the class by showing different antibacterial agents used by different cultures including First Nations people. Students would have got the opportunity of knowing the Traditional Knowledge of different cultures.
