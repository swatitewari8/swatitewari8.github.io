                Being a teacher candidate, I strongly believe that classroom management is an important aspect of effective teaching which not only enhances students' academic skills and competencies, but also social and emotional development. The classroom management not only includes how the teacher delivers the curriculum, but also how the students behave with others in the classroom and interact with the teacher. In my opinion, developing a respectful student teacher relationship is a very important characteristic for creating an effective learning environment. The relationship between student and teacher can be achieved through social supportive behaviours like emotional support, instrumental support, appraisal support and informational support. I can recall my Hindi language class as a grade 8 school student which I really enjoyed. My Hindi language teacher was awesome in explaining poetries. My teacher used to present the subject content in a very interesting way so that students would get engrossed in the poetry and could appreciate its content. He tried to put maximum effort into making the content interesting. While reciting the poetry, he used to walk forward and backward within the classroom with great gestures. He demonstrated wonderful teaching qualities which met my learning needs and I felt very connected. For me, his personality and teaching attributes had a significant impact. Due to his subject matter expertise and caring attitude about student’s individual needs, I used to respect him a lot and developed a respectful relationship with him. Respectful relationship between student and teacher creates a positive classroom climate which can be achieved by respecting student’s views, caring them, encouraging students to support each other and through with-it-ness.
The extrinsic motivation method of rewarding students has temporary effect while intrinsic motivation method has long lasting effect. The outdated carrots and sticks approach can never create a lasting commitment to an action or a value. The intrinsic motivation method demands a lot of efforts to work out as the teacher must be proactive in identifying and solving problems for the students and do meaningful conversations.  In intrinsic motivation, the motivation is less about students doing great work but rather students feeling great about their work. Teacher must be proactive in identifying the challenges that might make a student’s work difficult and then to address them sincerely. In this way, students are engaged meaningfully in their work and are enthusiastic about their work.  The learning through operant conditioning, are powerful tools in promoting desirable behaviour, especially in the classroom. Through positive reinforcement, the desired behaviour of students can be achieved in the classroom. The positive classroom climate can be achieved by developing a respectful student teacher relationship.
