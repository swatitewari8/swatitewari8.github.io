                <h2>Blog 4: How can we use social media to empower students for positive impacts in the community?
                </h2>

There’s no denying that social media has impacted the way we live, work, socialize and interact in school and outside school.  From Kindergarten to University, social media has created new ways of sharing information and co constructing knowledge in the learning process. But at the same time, social networking is blamed for distracting students from learning as they have exposure to other irrelevant contents of networking that is not age appropriate and cyberbullying. Therefore, selecting a social media for instructional purposes is a complex process as it will require many filters to be included according to social media policy of the respective organization. Creating a social media like a classroom Facebook page as a separate professional account will prevent ethical problems that might arise. Social media like blog postings, podcasts, vodcasts, songs, films, videos, YouTube, GIFs, photos, written articles, artefacts, Instagram, Pinterest, etc. can be used to reinforce the learning theories, concepts and spark discussion both in class, and also for out-of-class assignments. Teachers can ask students about how they are using Facebook to support college readiness and access (Marciano, 2015). Creating Facebook friendly classroom artifacts, encouraging students for tagging artifacts such as handouts, notes, graphic organizers, and written assignments will help students to share such artifacts via Facebook (Marciano, 2015). It is very important to explain to students and their families, and colleagues about the fact that the classroom Facebook page is helpful in learning.  Informing them will serve as a starting point for countering deficit- oriented notions of youth’s Facebook activities often promoted in the popular press (Marciano, 2015). Students can use “tweeting” as a literacy practice which ultimately impacts both informal and formal learning settings (Greenhow and Gleason, 2012). Students and teachers can organize projects that can positively impact the community by sharing information on social media. The ethical use of social media for making community groups within the classroom and outside classroom can make students thoughtful citizens in this digital ag

<h2>Blog 5: What digital divide issues remain to address and why?
</h2>

In the digital age of the 21st century, learners are required to use technology to think, to create, to innovate, to collaborate and to communicate effectively as knowledgeable citizens. Learners including teachers need access to digital tools and resources both inside and outside of school. According to Zutura (2022), access to the internet varies by country and therefore is one of the major causes of the digital divide. The reason for lack of access to technology may be absence or low connectivity of the internet due to geographic reasons, lack of resources to acquire the internet access, lack of knowledge and training to use them properly. According to Zutura (2022), the perception of ICTs (information and communication technologies) as predominantly male fields are also some of the obstacles which create a digital gender divide. The assistive technology related to digital tools is also important for students with disabilities which represents a framework of Universal Design for Learning (UDL). So, providing necessary technological accommodations to students with disabilities will promote the equity in accessing the digital tools. The old age people find it challenging to learn smartphones or phones with internet connection which also widens the digital divide. Therefore, it is very important for old age people and other digitally incompetent people to enhance their digital skills. The digital divide impedes access to information, accessing education, training and communication which eventually limits employment opportunities and creates a social division. The social division segments the techno savvy and non-tech savvy people. Digital tools have become a part of digital culture and therefore there is a need to implement an educational strategy that provides training and technical support to all public organizations, private companies, and civic people (Zutura, 2022).
