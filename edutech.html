                <h2>Blog 1: How can EdTech support the development of the 21st Century global skills? 
                </h2>
                <p>
                Communication in 21st century context refers to not only communicating effectively, orally, in writing but also with a variety of digital tools. Digital technology is playing a major role in society, and it can be used as a powerful tool in enabling deeper learning. The 21st Century demands for higher-order skills like critical thinking, communication, innovation, creativity, collaboration, and entrepreneurship (OME, 2016).
              </p>
              <p>
	Using Simulation Tools like Gizmos and PhET can help students for Critical Thinking and Problem Solving. Social media like blogs, web pages, networking sites such as Twitter, Instagram and YouTube are effective tools to encourage communication. Sharing ideas on FlipGrid and Google Classroom can facilitate conversations in groups. The Google Docs and Google Slides can be used to give real-time peer or feedback to learners. Google Classroom can also be used to provide teacher feedback in a timely, ongoing manner. These technologies are also excellent tools to integrate real-world applications and can be used effectively to encourage local and global citizenship. The game-based learning, with tools such as Kahoot, is ideal for engaging students. Canva is a great tool to use for creating posters and infographics.
</p>
<p>
	The technology should be used effectively and meaningfully for collaboration, accessibility, personalization, differentiation, engagement, and innovation (Caukin & Trail, 2019). The SAMR Model (Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, and Redefinition) explains well about integrating technology in the classroom. According to Caukin & Trail, 2019, SAMR model questions “at the Substitution level, “What will I gain by replacing the task with the technology?” At the Augmentation level, “Does the technology add new features that improve the task?” At the Modification level, “Does the task significantly change with the use of technology?” At the Redefinition level, “Does the technology allow for creation of a new task previously inconceivable?” The TPACK framework conveys that Knowledge of technology, content, and pedagogy functions within specific contexts (Mishra & Koehler, 2009).

<h2>Blog 2: How can digital literacy support the development of digital citizenship?
</h2>

<p>
As technology becomes a built-in part of our daily lives, digital citizenship emerges as one of the priorities among 21st century competencies. I will take the help of the Personal Digital Inquiry (PDI) framework to conceptualize what teaching and learning might look like while utilizing technology in the classrooms (Coiro, Castek, & Quinn, 2016). 
</p>
<p>
The PDI framework involves a set of practices in which students actively 1) inquire; 2) collaborate & discuss; 3) participate & create; and 4) reflect. I will take the help of the Personal Digital Inquiry (PDI) framework to conceptualize what teaching and learning might look like while utilizing technology in the classrooms (Coiro, Castek, & Quinn, 2016). The PDI framework involves a set of practices in which students actively 1) inquire; 2) collaborate & discuss; 3) participate & create; and 4) reflect.
</p>   
<p>
       For example, if I am teaching grade 6 about climate change, I should first do an inquiry about learning outcomes of the topic and then students are expected to inquire about information about everyday objects containing carbon. At this point, how technology can provide students access to accurate and relevant multimodal websites like Google Custom Search.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the second step, students will collaborate and discuss the knowledge they gained. At this point the teacher will prompt for a digital annotation tool (Citelighter) to collect and archive ideas in small groups. 
      </p>
      <p>

       The third step will be to participate and create notes, carbon flow diagrams, and design multimodal posters to share their solution. At this step, a teacher’s responsibility will be to provide digital tools (e.g.Glogster and MindMeister) to students to conduct their online research to come up with digital products which can reduce harmful effects of climate change. 
      </p>
      <p>
       The fourth step will be to reflect their knowledge to combat climate change and collect feedback from peers and teachers. At this step, teachers will involve students in using technologies like classroom Facebook, Twitter, and Podcasts to reflect and apply their work to real world environmental issues and make connections to their community. 
<br/>
       In this way, youth political identity and activism can also be created through digital citizenship education (Mitchell, 2016).

<h2>Blog 3: How can Web 2.0 and mobile learning make learning engaging and inclusive?
</h2>

<p>
Blogging provides a highly interactive way for teachers and students to express their ideas, be creative, reflective and gives confidence as they can promote their voice.
The blog posts offer an excellent place to reflect on lessons, discuss topics, and to get feedback from students, parents, and peers. According to Poth, Fernando, Okoye, & Karlin (2020), “The research suggests that reflecting on teaching practice can lead to improved lesson and learning quality within the classroom”. As a teacher I can create a classroom blog or website to inform students and parents about announcements, curricular activities, homework, upcoming trips and community projects. I can also create a student run class blog such as “What we did in class today”, and “what was the most difficult concept”. I can use Edublogs which are a great place to learn and have a complete control over all the content in student blogs. The Kidblog tool is also very useful which is now called Fanschool (Gonzalez, 2022). 
</p>
<p>
	The most common mobile devices are smartphone, laptop and tablet laptops which are used in school and universities. Using the digital camera found on most cell phones, students can capture images of geometric shapes in the real world that depict concepts they are learning, give their feedback through QR code, and illustrate word problems in a series of photos which can be posted on Flickr (http://flickr.com). After completing an assigned reading, students can use a cell phone to record a podcast or vodcast and post their thoughts on teacher-posed questions. I can use web sites such as polleverywhere (http://www.polleverywhere.com/) or MobiOde (http://www.mobiode.com/) to conduct quick polls, short objective quizzes where students can provide their answers using their cell phones (Brooks-Young, 2010).

                <h2>Blog 4: How can we use social media to empower students for positive impacts in the community?
                </h2>
                <p>
                There’s no denying that social media has impacted the way we live, work, socialize and interact in school and outside school.  From Kindergarten to University, social media has created new ways of sharing information and co constructing knowledge in the learning process. But at the same time, social networking is blamed for distracting students from learning as they have exposure to other irrelevant contents of networking that is not age appropriate and cyberbullying. Therefore, selecting a social media for instructional purposes is a complex process as it will require many filters to be included according to social media policy of the respective organization. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Creating a social media like a classroom Facebook page as a separate professional account will prevent ethical problems that might arise. Social media like blog postings, podcasts, vodcasts, songs, films, videos, YouTube, GIFs, photos, written articles, artefacts, Instagram, Pinterest, etc. can be used to reinforce the learning theories, concepts and spark discussion both in class, and also for out-of-class assignments. Teachers can ask students about how they are using Facebook to support college readiness and access (Marciano, 2015). Creating Facebook friendly classroom artifacts, encouraging students for tagging artifacts such as handouts, notes, graphic organizers, and written assignments will help students to share such artifacts via Facebook (Marciano, 2015). 
              </p>
              <p>
                It is very important to explain to students and their families, and colleagues about the fact that the classroom Facebook page is helpful in learning.  Informing them will serve as a starting point for countering deficit- oriented notions of youth’s Facebook activities often promoted in the popular press (Marciano, 2015). Students can use “tweeting” as a literacy practice which ultimately impacts both informal and formal learning settings (Greenhow and Gleason, 2012). Students and teachers can organize projects that can positively impact the community by sharing information on social media. The ethical use of social media for making community groups within the classroom and outside classroom can make students thoughtful citizens in this digital age.

<h2>Blog 5: What digital divide issues remain to address and why?
</h2>
<p>
In the digital age of the 21st century, learners are required to use technology to think, to create, to innovate, to collaborate and to communicate effectively as knowledgeable citizens. Learners including teachers need access to digital tools and resources both inside and outside of school. According to Zutura (2022), access to the internet varies by country and therefore is one of the major causes of the digital divide. 
</p>
<p>
       The reason for lack of access to technology may be absence or low connectivity of the internet due to geographic reasons, lack of resources to acquire the internet access, lack of knowledge and training to use them properly. According to Zutura (2022), the perception of ICTs (information and communication technologies) as predominantly male fields is also some of the obstacles which create a digital gender divide. The assistive technology related to digital tools is also important for students with disabilities which represents a framework of Universal Design for Learning (UDL). So, providing necessary technological accommodations to students with disabilities will promote the equity in accessing the digital tools. 
      </p>
      <p>
       The old age people find it challenging to learn smartphones or phones with internet connection which also widens the digital divide. Therefore, it is very important for old age people and other digitally incompetent people to enhance their digital skills. The digital divide impedes access to information, accessing education, training and communication which eventually limits employment opportunities and creates a social division. The social division segments the techno savvy and non-tech savvy people. Digital tools have become a part of digital culture and therefore there is a need to implement an educational strategy that provides training and technical support to all public organizations, private companies, and civic people (Zutura, 2022).
