      <div class="display-4">About me</div>
      <p>
        My name is Swati Tewari and was born and brought up in Kanpur, U.P.,
        India. I am currently in my first year of the B.Ed. program at
        university of Ottawa. I am a teacher candidate of year 2023. I am in the
        intermediate/Secondary (I/S ) division and my teachable subjects are
        Chemistry and Mathematics. Learning has been my passion and I have been
        a continuous learner. I hold a PhD degree in Organic Chemistry from
        Central Drug Research Institute, India; an MSc degree in Chemistry from
        Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur, India and an MBA degree
        from University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada. I have taught as a part
        time professor in Sheridan College, Brampton, Canada, Dawson college,
        Montréal, Canada and Amity University, Noida, India. Some of the
        subjects that I taught at the undergraduate and graduate levels include
        Chemistry, Physics for Chemical Sciences, Environmental Sciences,
        Introductory Mathematics and Management domain. I also worked as
        research scientist and research manager in pharmaceutical industries in
        Canada. I also worked as a post doctoral fellow in Max-Planck Institute
        of Molecular Physiology, Dortmund, Germany and City University of New
        York, NY, USA. My research area has been on drug discovery and design as
        antiparasitic, antibacterial and pain killer agents, and published
        several research articles in peer reviewed journals.

      <h2>Camping</h2>
      <p>
        When the sun in shining and the weather is nice, you can be sure that I
        will be out for camping! i have done most of my camping in KOA camps in
        North America. I had also a great opportunity to do camping in India in
        2012 during Kumbh-Mela, Allahabd city in a totally different setting. I
        have been an avid camper since 2009 and have done camping in various
        national parks and beaches in provinces of Canada (British columbia,
        Alberta, PrinceEdward Island and Quebec) and USA (Montanna, South
        Dakota, Wyomming, Idaho, Utah, Colorado, Michigan, Ohio, and
        Pennsylvania). My last camping was in August, 2021 in Sauble Beach,
        Ontario, Canada.

      <div class="display-4">Teaching Philosophy</div>
      <p>
        Teaching is one of the most rewarding professions which gives power to
        make a difference in thousands of children’s life. It gives immense
        pleasure and satisfaction as teaching is a great support system to
        fulfill dreams of students. I feel so much powerful when I say to a
        student that “I believe in you” and “You can do it”. Teaching is the
        most prestigious profession as you are remembered by so many students on
        which you have impacted positively. As a teacher, I feel that I am the
        richest person in this world as what I invested in educating my
        students, this society got them in returns as doctors, engineers,
        industrialists, home makers, scientists, social activists, singers,
        professors, teachers, etc. I strongly believe that in today’s globalized
        world, cultural diversity is an essential element of sustainable
        development which calls for revisioning of the educational system in
        public schools to introduce a more effective method of teaching diverse
        youth. An exceptional teacher understands that education is more beyond
        academic excellence. In my opinion, school is a place where students not
        only learn subjects but also life skills. Schooling is not simply a
        teaching skill to students but rather developing self-knowledge which
        helps them to live and understand this world. The teaching skills to
        manage classes, maintain order and create learning experiences for
        students are not meaningful unless they are tied to moral and ethical
        values of teaching. Moral issues are integral part of school
        organization and administration. Society exerts forces on schools and
        schools become proxy for all things. What happens in society cascades in
        schools and therefore, societal problems reflect on teachers’ onus in
        return. In my opinion, teachers can change the society by leading the
        society instead of following the society. I strongly believe that
        teachers should cultivate a sense of community and social responsibility
        beyond academic excellence for holistic development.
