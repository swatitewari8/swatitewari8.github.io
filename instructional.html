            <p>
                The three instructional approaches: Universal Design for Learning (UDL), differentiated instruction, and the tiered approach to prevention and intervention can address the need of diverse group of students. 
                I remember my teaching experience at Sheridan college where I have taken chemistry labs and conducted lab experiments where I got the opportunity of appreciating the above-mentioned instructional approaches. Students need consistency, clarity, trusted technology, and accessible lessons. For consistency, I provided predictable course layout and teaching practices. For clarity, I posted clear expectations on D2L in each lesson module. For the trusted technology, I posted an explicit course outline with lesson plan on with detailed course navigation instructions. Learning schedule template and learning activity breakdown was be posted on D2L. Course material was presented in multiple formats as articles, textbooks, videos, podcasts, online activities, and textbook exercises. I adopted multiple ways of communication to interact with students through email and designated office hours. I provided additional time for disability related accommodation. A checklist was provided of what needs to be completed and in what order, including interim dues dates to support student planning and offered instructions in several locations to support convenient access. Students were given choice in submitting some assignments as written text, recorded video, audio file, voice over in power point. Weekly assignments were open for entire week. Students were informed promptly through emailing and updating course calendar and online course announcements for assignment due dates.
                I adopted an inquiry-based learning approach and provided guided inquiry-based laboratory worksheets on the aspects of content, reasoning, calculation, analysis, interpretation of data, results, discussion, linguistics, and graphics. The students reacted positively to the use of this guided inquiry-based worksheet. This strategy worked out very well as students had plenty of scaffolding through the worksheet but there was no scaffolding while performing their experiments.  Students demonstrated their understanding and skills autonomously while performing lab experiments without scaffolding.
                Before applying differentiate instruction, I can focus on one strategy of giving one worksheet with different levels of problem set of chapters. Some students will be able to solve basic level problems while some students can solve advanced level problems. In this way, I can assess the level of each student and accordingly Individual Education Plan (IEP) lesson plans can be created.
                I strongly agree that effective differentiation requires close monitoring of studentsâ€™ proficiency and therefore responsive teachers take time to design assessment with their students in mind. I liked the concept of tiering which ensures that assessment tasks are differentiated appropriately. For effective learning there should be a balance of written (write), performance (do), and oral (say) assessments and therefore I will try to make the content engaging by adopting three tiered components-Write, do and speak.
