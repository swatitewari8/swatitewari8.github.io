                <li>In the past, I lived in Quebec, Alberta and now I am living in Ontario. I have travelled to many parts of Canada from east to west. I acknowledge the enduring presence of Indigenous people wherever I lived. </li>
	<li>Currently, I am living in the campuses of the University of Waterloo which are situated on the Haldimand Tract, land that was granted to the Haudenosaunee of the Six Nations of the Grand River, and are within the territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabe, and Haudenosaunee peoples. </li>
    <li>We also acknowledge the enduring presence and deep traditional knowledge, laws, and philosophies of the Indigenous Peoples with whom we share this land today. We are all treaty people with a responsibility to honor all our relations.</li>
    <li>There has been a long history of trauma, prejudice, and systemic racism against Indigenous Peoples. The colonial society has disrespected all the basic human rights boundaries, repeatedly, for generations. </li>
    <li>Through policies the Canadian Government has embedded inequitable systems that disadvantaged Indigenous people while privileging the settler population.</li>
    <li>Settlers’ colonization has been dictating how the land and resources of indigenous people will be used and distributed. They dictate what will be provided in education, security and what will be the limit of participation in economics and politics.  </li>
    <li>These controls are intended to keep indigenous people dependent and oppressed. This has created a climate of distrust and hesitance felt by Indigenous people when non-Indigenous settlers claim to be their allies. Indigenous people have come to be suspicious of and distrust non-Indigenous people. Responding to this challenge, there has been an urgent need of decolonization.  </li>
    <li>It is not enough to express no prejudice towards Indigenous peoples but working along with them to change unjust and inequitable colonial system.</li>
    <li>Allyship has been considered as a mean for the reconciliation of historical and contemporary wrongdoings and the rectification of the inequitable colonial systems. </li>
    <li>The notion of superiority has been impressed upon non-native settlers from birth which shows the negative colonial mentality and that’s why they have tendency to always lead. </li>
    <li>This fostering relationship can be achieved through walking besides them, not in front of them. </li>
    <li>Allyship is about supporting not leading and establishing meaningful relationships that creates accountability and responsibility for sustained coexistence.</li>
    <li>The designation “ally” can’t be earned by the non-Indigenous person who just aspires to be an ally, but it is the domain of Indigenous peoples to truly evaluate a non-Indigenous person to be their ally.</li>
    <li>Allyship is a continuous effort of being self-reflexive and working in a de-colonial manner which can be achieved by building trust by respecting boundaries, being reliable and accountable, respecting the trust vault, showing integrity, showing non-judgement, and by being generous with our assumptions.</li>
    <li>To be an ally with indigenous people, non-native settlers must learn to identify and disrupt racism encountered by indigenous people. Settlers can choose the privileges they were born with and use those privileges to intervene in racist practices, build alliances and make a better Canada together.</li>
