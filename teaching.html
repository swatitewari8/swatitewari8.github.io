              Teaching is one of the most rewarding professions which gives power to make a difference in thousands of children’s life. It gives immense pleasure and satisfaction as teaching is a great support system to fulfill dreams of students. I feel so much powerful when I say to a student that “I believe in you” and “You can do it”. Teaching is the most prestigious profession as you are remembered by so many students on which you have impacted positively. As a teacher, I feel that I am the richest person in this world as what I invested in educating my students, this society got them in returns as doctors, engineers, industrialists, home makers, scientists, social activists, singers, professors, teachers, etc.

       I strongly believe that in today’s globalized world, cultural diversity is an essential element of sustainable development which calls for revisioning of the educational system in public schools to introduce a more effective method of teaching diverse youth. An exceptional teacher understands that education is more beyond academic excellence. In my opinion, school is a place where students not only learn subjects but also life skills. Schooling is not simply a teaching skill to students but rather developing self-knowledge which helps them to live and understand this world. The teaching skills to manage classes, maintain order and create learning experiences for students are not meaningful unless they are tied to moral and ethical values of teaching. Moral issues are integral part of school organization and administration. Society exerts forces on schools and schools become proxy for all things. What happens in society cascades in schools and therefore, societal problems reflect on teachers’ onus in return. In my opinion, teachers can change the society by leading the society instead of following the society. I strongly believe that teachers should cultivate a sense of community and social responsibility beyond academic excellence for holistic development.
